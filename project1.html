									<h1>SYSTEMS ANALYSIS AND SOFTWARE DESIGN PROJECT</h1>

								<h5>The home page for the website has a navigation bar at the top of the page, with a slideshow of different images underneath it, followed by the contact information for the business.</h5>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/sysAnalysis/home.png" alt="" /></div>
								<h5>The news page shows the user the list of the different news entries that the admin writes under the admin page.</h5>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/sysAnalysis/news.png" alt="" /></div>
								<h5>The log-in and sign-up pages prompt the user to input their information to rather log-into their user account, or to create their user account.</h5>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/sysAnalysis/login.png" alt="" /></div>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/sysAnalysis/signup.png" alt="" /></div>
								<h5>This is an example of the changes in the home page once the user is signed in: a success message is shown and the register tab is now available as well as the client page tab.</h5>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/sysAnalysis/loggedIn.png" alt="" /></div>
								<h5>The register page shows the client a calander that is populated only by classes made for their skill level. Then there are four different options to be shown for a given date: the day could not have a class where 'N/A' populates the date, 
										the class on that date could be taken in which case 'booked' is populated, the class could be available so a green button with 'book' populated is shown, and then a group class could be available so two 'book' buttons are shown side by side.
										If the client chooses to sign up for an available date they press the book button, they are sent to an email verification page, and then they are sent back to the home screen after successfully verifying their email. 									
								</h5>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/sysAnalysis/calendar.png" alt="" /></div>
								<h5>The client page tells the client when their next class that they have signed up for is, then eight different text boxes are shown with six of the boxes being populated by the information that is currently in their account. They have the option to change the information on their account then they can press the 'Change Information' button to send the newly changed information to the database.</h5>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/sysAnalysis/client.png" alt="" /></div>
								<h5>The admin page is where the owner or admin for the website can lookup clients, change their information, send mass emails, create news posts, create a new lesson that they are available for with the option to set the skill level and whether it is a solo lesson or group lesson, and change their preferences for how that particular admin recieves notifications.</h5>
